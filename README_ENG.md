# Space war

The game is written in the style of 80s console games.
The spaceship flies through the stars. Space debris is constantly falling on it.
The player's task is to dodge space debris, which becomes more and more over time.
After some time, a laser gun appears on the ship, with which you can destroy space debris.
The ship is controlled using the cursor keys, a shot from a cannon is achieved by pressing the "space" key.

## How to install

Python3 should already be installed.
In the directory with the game, copy the files with the `*.py` extension and the `figures` folder with the figures.
Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with Python2) to install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to start

The program is launched from the command line. To run the program using the `cd` command, you first need to go to the folder with the program file.
The game is launched as follows:
```
python main.py
```

## Project Goals

The code was written for educational purposes in an online course for web developers [dvmn.org](https://dvmn.org/).
