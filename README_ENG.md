# Space war

A blank for the game, written in the style of 80s console games.
So far, a star field and a spaceship controlled with the cursor keys have been made.

## How to install

Python3 should already be installed.
Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with Python2) to install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to start

The program is launched from the command line. To run the program using the `cd` command, you first need to go to the folder with the program file.
After that, on the command line, write:
```
python main.py
```

## Project Goals

The code was written for educational purposes in an online course for web developers [dvmn.org](https://dvmn.org/).
